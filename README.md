Trying to use target display mode imac with a windows pc input

Someone needs to make a program to make it possible to use an Imac(thunderbolt) in target display mode as a display for a windows pc (ofcourse with display output thru thunderbolt) 

For al the people who still have a good functioning imac(2011-2015) with a great display, but the system is just a bit to slow for most things nowadays. 
With a macbook this functions works great, but it would be wonderfull if it also can be used from a windows pc (gaming etc.).

I hope someone reeds this.
